# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to assist Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, with determining whether a budget of $10,000 will allow her to be successful in funding her play, Fever. With the insights from the Excel analysis of the crowdfunding data, it can help Louise determine the specific factors that make a project's fundraising campaign successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was performed by creating charts based on the data in the Kickstarter table.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first line chart is titled **"theater outcomes by launch date"** which plots how many theater campaigns were successful, failed and canceled over the months. The x axis plots each month from January to December, while the y axis plots the number of successful, failed, or canceled theater campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second line chart is titled **"outcomes based on goals"** which plots the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays in the different goal ranges. The x axis plots the goal range starting from less than $1,000 to a goal of $50,000 or more, while the y axis plots the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges encountered include setting the criteria for the **"outcomes based on goals"** so that only successful, failed, and canceled plays were counted instead of the entire data set. I was successful in overcoming the challenge by ensuring that the formula was referencing the correct column for the outcomes and subcategories. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One conclusion that can be drawn from the "outcomes based on launch date" is that the most theater campaigns were successful in meeting their goal in the month of May.
Another conclusion is that the month that had the least amount of successful theater campaigns was in December. It may be best for Louise to do her campaign in May and avoid doing her campaign in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

One conclusion that can be drawn from the "outcomes based on goals" is that all the plays that were in the $45,000 to $49,999 goal range failed.
Another conclusion is that there were no canceled plays at all. From the results, we can see that for the $10,000 to $14,999 range, both the percentage successful and the percentage failed are roughly around 50%. Based on this chart, if Louise would like to set a goal of $10,000 for her play, Fever, there may be approximately a one-in-two chance to succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitations of this particular dataset is we don't know why things were successful or failed or canceled.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other tables or graphs that could be created include the histogram.
